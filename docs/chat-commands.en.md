# Chat Commands

This is the supplementary command and pane-control reference for the chat UI. README keeps the overview; this file keeps the current list.

## Pane Trace

- mobile: tap a thinking row to open the embedded Pane Trace viewer
- desktop: click a thinking row to open the selected agent's Pane Trace in a popup window
- on desktop, `Terminal` opens the real terminal window
- on mobile, `Terminal` routes to Pane Trace instead

## Slash Commands

Type `/` at the start of the composer to open command suggestions.

| command | behavior |
|------|------|
| `/memo [text]` | self memo to `user`; Import attachments alone are enough even without body text |
| `/raw <text>` | one-shot raw paste into the pane without the normal `[From: User]` header or `msg-id` |
| `/brief` | open the `default` brief |
| `/brief set <name>` | open `brief_<name>.md` |
| `/model` | send `model` to the selected pane |
| `/up [count]` | send up-navigation to the selected pane; default count is 1 |
| `/down [count]` | send down-navigation to the selected pane; default count is 1 |
| `/restart` | restart the selected agent pane |
| `/resume` | resume the selected agent pane |
| `/interrupt` | send `Esc` to the selected agent pane |
| `/enter` | send `Enter` to the selected agent pane |

`count` for `/up` and `/down` is clamped into the 1..100 range.

## Quick Actions

These are the controls exposed under the composer and its `Cmd` / `Command` menus.

| UI | behavior |
|------|------|
| `Import` | add local-device files into the session uploads area |
| `Raw` / `Raw Send` | toggle raw-send mode or send the current message as raw input |
| `Brief` / `Send Brief` | send a saved brief to the selected targets |
| `Load` / `Load Memory` | send the current `memory.md` to the selected agent |
| `Memory` / `Save Memory` | update `memory.md` from the current conversation |
| `Save` / `Save Log` | save a pane-log snapshot immediately |
| `Restart` | restart the selected agent pane |
| `Resume` | resume the selected agent pane |
| `Ctrl+C` | send `Ctrl+C` to the selected agent pane |
| `Enter` | send `Enter` to the selected agent pane |
| `Esc` / `Interrupt` | send `Esc` to the selected agent pane |

## Notes

- pane-control commands and quick actions require at least one selected target
- raw actions are direct pane input, not normal structured chat messages
- commands are expected to grow over time, so this file is intended to be the update point rather than README
